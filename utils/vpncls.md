Here are some sub-todos and recommendations for implementing plural class methods in `` vpncls.py ``:

1. Implement a `` Peers `` class that represents a collection of `` Peer `` objects. This class should have the following methods:
    
    *   `` __init__(self, peers: List[Peer]) ``: Initializes a new `` Peers `` object with a list of `` Peer `` objects.
    *   `` add_peer(self, peer: Peer) -&gt; None ``: Adds a `` Peer `` object to the collection.
    *   `` remove_peer(self, peer: Peer) -&gt; None ``: Removes a `` Peer `` object from the collection.

2. Implement a `` Routers `` class that represents a collection of `` Router `` objects. This class should have the following methods:

    *   `` __init__(self, routers: List[Router]) ``: Initializes a new `` Routers `` object with a list of `` Router `` objects.
    *   `` add_router(self, router: Router) -&gt; None ``: Adds a `` Router `` object to the collection.
    *   `` remove_router(self, router: Router) -&gt; None ``: Removes a `` Router `` object from the collection.

3. Modify the `` VPN `` class to use the `` Peers `` and `` Routers `` classes instead of the `` peers `` list:

    *   Change the `` peers `` attribute to `` all_peers `` and make it private.
    *   Add a `` routers `` attribute of type `` Routers `` and initialize it with the list of routers from `` all_peers ``.
    *   Add a `` peers `` attribute of type `` Peers `` and initialize it with the list of peers from `` all_peers ``.
    *   Implement a `` add_peer `` method that takes a `` Peer `` object and adds it to the `` peers `` collection.
    *   Implement a `` remove_peer `` method that takes a `` Peer `` object and removes it from the `` peers `` collection.
    *   Implement a `` add_router `` method that takes a `` Router `` object and adds it to the `` routers `` collection.
    *   Implement a `` remove_router `` method that takes a `` Router `` object and removes it from the `` routers `` collection.
    *   Modify the `` endpoints `` property to use the `` routers `` collection instead of the `` peers `` list.

4. Modify the `` Pool `` class to use a set instead of a list for `` allocated_addresses ``:

    *   Change the `` allocated_addresses `` attribute to a set instead of a list.
    *   Modify the `` allocate_address `` method to use the `` in `` operator to check if an address is in the set instead of using `` not in ``.
    *   Modify the `` unallocate_address `` method to use the `` discard `` method instead of `` remove ``.

5. Add a `` Peer.__post_init__ `` method that initializes the `` is_router `` attribute to `` False ``.
6. Change the `` BasePeer.__repr__ `` method to use the `` f-string `` format instead of the `` format `` method.
7. Modify the `` VPN.__repr__ `` method to use the `` f-string `` format instead of concatenation.
8. Modify the `` VPN.__init__ `` method to accept a `` Pool `` object instead of a `` network `` argument.
9. Modify the `` VPN.add_peer `` method to take a `` Peer `` object instead of separate `` address `` and `` endpoint `` arguments.
